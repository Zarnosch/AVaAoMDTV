Take this kiss upon the brow!
And, in parting from you now,
thus much let me avow.
You are not wrong, who deem
that my days have been a dream;
yet if hope has flown away
in a night, or in a day,
in a vision, or in none,
is it therefore the less gone?
All that we see or seem
is but a dream within a dream.

I stand amid the roar
of a surf-tormented shore,
and I hold within my hand
grains of the golden sand.
How few! yet how they creep
through my fingers to the deep,
while I weep, while I weep!
O God! can I not grasp
them with a tighter clasp?
O God! can I not save
one from the pitiless wave?
Is all that we see or seem
but a dream within a dream?

I carry your heart with me (i carry it in
my heart) i am never without it (anywhere
i go you go, my dear; and whatever is done
by only me is your doing, my darling).
I fear no fate  (for you are my fate, my sweet).
I want no world (for beautiful you are my world, my true)
and it's you are whatever a moon has always meant
and whatever a sun will always sing is you.

Here is the deepest secret nobody knows
(here is the root of the root and the bud of the bud
and the sky of the sky of a tree called life; which grows
higher than the soul can hope or mind can hide)
and this is the wonder that's keeping the stars apart.

I carry your heart (i carry it in my heart)

It would be life,
and life is over there
behind the shelf.

The sexton keeps the key to,
putting up
our life, his porcelain,
like a cup.

Discarded of the housewife,
quaint or broken;
a newer Sevres pleases,
old ones crack.

I could not die with you,
for one must wait
to shut the other's gaze down,
you could not.

And I, could I stand by
and see you freeze,
without my right of frost,
death's privilege?

Nor could I rise with you,
because your face
would put out Jesus'.
That new grace

glow plain and foreign
on my homesick eye,
except that you, than he
shone closer by.
