One day, overnight, the world turned violet. Just about everything turned violet from the sky and ocean and mountains to the trees and animals and people and from the tallest skyscrapers to the tiniest ant. People sat around looking at one another wondering if they were dreaming. But nobody woke up and things stayed violet, all except for a single Blue Jay who hadn't changed color and stayed the brightest blue.
Being the only thing in the world that wasn't violet, he was caught and put in a cage.
People were shocked. Some were afraid and some were amazed and a few thought it funny, because along with everyone else, the President was very violet. Whole families were violet as were teachers, movie stars, doctors, nurses, gas station attendants, the Queen of England, the President of Mozambique, taxi-drivers, everybody. They went from place to place in their violet cars and buses and rode violet bikes and sat on violet furniture and ate violet food. Even Hershey's candy bars had turned all violet as had Skittles and M&M's. Girls generally thought this yucky, but some boys thought it was pretty neat.
The smartest scientists in the world gathered to figure it out. Was something wrong with people's eyes or was it a trick of nature? They did studies and tests and analyzed and evaluated and debated and wrote article after article, but couldn't explain it.
And no longer could people say they felt "blue" or were "green" with envy or had a "green" thumb. So what they said and how they said it began to change. Some people said violet was now the most important color in the world because it was everywhere. Others said that violet had no importance at all because there was too much of it. They discussed and argued, joined clubs, held debates, wrote books, and produced movies all about the issue of the importance or unimportance of the color violet.
The color of the Blue Jay became a big issue because he had such a little bit of blue and the world had such a whole lot of violet. People argued about the importance of that. Some said the Blue Jay must be a very special bird or maybe not a bird at all because he alone had kept his true color. Others said this was silly, that the Blue Jay ate bird seed and drank water and fluffed his feathers and that other than his special color he was still just a bird.
It was exactly one year to the day after the world had turned violet that people awoke to find the world had turned yellow. All except the Blue Jay.
In some ways a yellow world isn't any different than a violet world. People simply said yellow instead of violet when they talked about things. Only now the Blue Jay was more important than ever because he alone had stayed the color blue and people argued about what that meant. They lined up for miles just to take a look at him.
For the next two years, exactly on the day the world had turned violet and then yellow, it turned new colors: first orange and then pink. Still the Blue Jay stayed blue, causing ever greater disagreement -- until in the fifth year the whole world turned blue.
The first thing people asked was what about the Blue Jay. Had he stayed blue? Yes, he was still the same color. No longer were there two colors in the world, but just one -- the color blue. And because the Blue Jay was a color like everybody and everything else people began to lose interest. Now that he was neither more nor less important crowds stopped coming and one day, six months into the year that the world had turned blue, somebody let him out of his cage and he flew off looking happy to be free.
The very next morning the world regained its rainbow of colors as if nothing had ever happened. At first this was a novelty but soon people forgot the world had once been all violet. They forgot the world had once turned yellow, then orange, then pink, and then blue. They returned to saying they felt "blue" or were "green" with envy or had a "green" thumb.
But on occasion they wondered where the Blue Jay had gone and how he was doing and, most of all, if he was still the color blue and what it had all meant.

The Halloween House is big and old. I'm told that on Halloween night things happen there. 
Now Suzie's moved in--she's only --along with her brother, her father and mother, and little Picador. He's their dog. Well, maybe half a dog. He's a Chihuahua, as small as they come. 
Suzie's room is in the attic. It's no fun. With a high ceiling, cold and gloomy, and shadows that run halfway up the walls. Suzie hides under the blanket. Picador too. Come on, he's no guard dog. 
Suzie's mom bought her a bear. A teddy bear named Teddy. He's big and fluffy and Suzie adores him. "I love you so much" she says. Then she wraps her arms around him, snuggling like a cat ready to purr while Picador buries himself in all that fur. 
The Halloween House's attic may be scary, but Teddy's not. Around his neck he wears a blue scarf with red polka dots. On his back paws are black tennis shoes tied with lace and plenty of knots. 
Something is silly about that teddy bear. He's got a goofy smile from ear to ear. It's kind of lopsided and sweet, although not quite complete. He was cheap when Suzie's mom bought him at the Dollar Store. 
But his smile is always there. 
When scratching and squeaking come from the walls, 
Teddy smiles. 
When clothes on the floor become strange figures in piles, 
Teddy smiles. 
When an invisible spider's miles of cobweb fades away in the morning, 
Teddy smiles. 
Tonight is Suzie's first Halloween at the Halloween House. She has finished her trick or treating, she did it earlier in the evening. She dressed up as a pumpkin with an orange glow--and now her two bags of candy overflow onto the floor. 
It's midnight and everyone's asleep. Not a peep, until suddenly there's a tapping at the door. 
"Tap, tap....tap." It starts out soft and low and then changes into a steady beat, beat, beat as though a giant's heart is nudging the door. 
Teddy smiles. 
A thin mist streams from a crack in the corner, turns into a snake sliding across the floor. 
Teddy smiles. 
Next, at the window appears a witch  years old with a black hat hiding half her face and the wrinkles it holds. She slips right through the glass as though it isn't there at all. Once inside, she stands up, six feet tall. 
Teddy smiles. 
A long legged spider with big fangs drops from the ceiling and hangs only five feet over the bed where Suzie and Picador peacefully sleep. 
The snake, the witch and the spider slither, creep and dangle closer, growing bigger as they go. They're up to no good. This can't be happening. 
But Teddy is watching. He smiles no more. The upturned side of his lip droops down, while the other part of his lip lifts up. Teddy's smile turns into a snarl. 
When the three monsters almost reach the bed, Teddy gets up. But more than that, he begins to grow, although much faster and bigger than they. His tennis shoes pop off and his scarf floats away. Sweet, smiling Teddy turns into a Grizzly bear, the biggest, meanest Grizzly of your imagination. 
Standing on his back paws, stretched to the ceiling Teddy is terrifying. Fortunately, Suzie and Picador are still sleep. 
The snake, the witch, and the spider stop growing. They stare at him. There's wonder and shock in their eyes. This is an unexpected surprise. 
Then Teddy roars! It's so loud, it doesn't help to cover your ears. And the ghouls hear it. This Grizzly is beyond their worst fears. With a puff and a poof they disappear. 
Suzie is instantly awake, her eyes big and round. With a frightened yip Picador bolts from under the covers trembling with dread. But they see nothing, nothing at all, because the monsters have fled. 
And Teddy is suddenly Teddy again. How could that be? It happened so fast, there was nothing to see, except his shoes are across the room and his scarf is at the bottom of the bed. 
Gone is the snake. Gone is the witch. Gone is the spider and the beating heart at the door. It's quite obvious they'll never return. Nevermore. At least not to this Halloween House so long as this bear stays around and he will stay. Because he is loved.  
Have no fear, Teddy's here. 
...and he smiles. 
	 

Once upon a time there was an old woman who loved baking gingerbread. She would bake gingerbread cookies, cakes, houses and gingerbread people, all decorated with chocolate and peppermint, caramel candies and colored frosting.
She lived with her husband on a farm at the edge of town. The sweet spicy smell of gingerbread brought children skipping and running to see what would be offered that day.
Unfortunately the children gobbled up the treats so fast that the old woman had a hard time keeping her supply of flour and spices to continue making the batches of gingerbread. Sometimes she suspected little hands of having reached through her kitchen window because gingerbread pieces and cookies would disappear. One time a whole gingerbread house vanished mysteriously. She told her husband, "Those naughty children are at it again. They don't understand all they have to do is knock on the door and I'll give them my gingerbread treats."
One day she made a special batch of gingerbread men because they were extra big. Unfortunately for the last gingerbread man she ran out of batter and he was half the size of the others.
She decorated the gingerbread men with care, each having socks, shirt and pants of different colors. When it came to the little gingerbread man she felt sorry for him and gave him more color than the others. "It doesn't matter he's small," she thought, "He'll still be tasty."
Putting the rack on the kitchen windowsill she left it there to cool and went to finish her laundry. The gingerbread men lay quietly, their frosted eyes gazing at the sky with its puffy clouds.
At that moment a voice came from nowhere. "Get up. Get up. Come with me."
Everyone looked to see who was speaking.
It was a butterfly flying just outside the window. Butterflies are naturally beautiful, but her wings were an exceptionally pretty marbled blue.
"Come with me," she urged again.
The gingerbread men didn't react except to keep staring. All but the smallest gingerbread man who jumped up from the tray and leaped off the kitchen windowsill onto the grass below faster than you could say "hurry."
"Where are we going?" he asked breathlessly.
"Away." And before the butterfly had finished speaking children appeared in the yard. Spying the little gingerbread man they started shrieking with delight and began chasing him.
"Stop, stop," they shouted. "We want to eat you."
But with his little legs churning the gingerbread man only ran faster. He yelled,
"I won't stop.
Run, run as fast as you can.
You can't catch me.
I'm the gingerbread man."
And truly those children could not catch him. Once out of their sight he continued running until he had reached a pasture where two horses were grazing. He sat down on a rock near the fence.
"Don't stop," said the butterfly fluttering nearby.
"I want to rest," he argued.
That was a mistake as one of the horses trotted over to the fence and whinnied. "Oh you smell so good little gingerbread man. Come over here so I can smell you better."
The little gingerbread man shook his head, but suddenly that horse jumped the fence and began galloping after him, so he had to run even faster. He called out,
"I outran children and I'll outrun you.
Run, run as fast as you can.
You can't catch me.
I'm the gingerbread man."
And truly, that horse could not catch him.
The next time he rested the little gingerbread man took care to lie amongst the grass well off the road where no one would see him.
"Everybody wants to eat me," he complained to the butterfly. "Do you want to eat me, too?"
Laughing she answered. "I love the smell of gingerbread. It's better than my favorite flowers. But I sip nectar, not gingerbread. Besides, you're my friend and friends don't eat friends."
Pleased to hear that he had a friend the little gingerbread man was about to reply when again they were interrupted. A farmer's dog with a keen nose had come to investigate. Licking his muzzle at the sight of the gingerbread man, the dog said.
"Excuse me for interrupting, but little gingerbread man you look so good. I mean tired. Please stay awhile and rest if you like."
As the dog talked, he stepped closer and closer. The closer he stepped, the more nervous became the little gingerbread man. When the butterfly flitted from her grass perch in alarm, the little gingerbread man took off running with the dog nipping at his tiny heels. He shouted,
"I outran children. I outran a horse and I'll outrun you too.
Run, run as fast as you can.
You can't catch me.
I'm the gingerbread man."
And truly that dog could not catch him.
At last the little gingerbread man and the butterfly reached a stream.
It wasn't a very big stream unless you are a tiny gingerbread man. To him it was a river. From out behind a bush sauntered a red fox stopping to stretch because he had just awakened from a nap. Looking at the gingerbread man he said nonchalantly, "May I help you?"
The butterfly was quick to respond. "No thank you. We're going to fly across this stream. We don't need your help."
Smiling, the wily fox glanced at the butterfly before turning to the little gingerbread man, "You're going to carry him? I've no doubt Ms. Butterfly that you have good intentions, but you're only a bug. You couldn't carry anything anywhere, let alone this gingerbread man across the stream. You'll drop him. I guarantee it!"
The little gingerbread man was confused. He knew that his butterfly friend had good intentions but could she really carry him? He doubted it. Her wings were so thin and delicate. The thought of him falling into the cold water and crumbling to damp bits was frightening. He said to the fox, "I outran children. I outran a horse, and I outran a dog. Will you keep me safe and not eat me?"
"Of course!" the wily fox quickly assured him before the butterfly could object. "I eat only meat and I had a full meal just before my nap. Here, ride on my bushy tail. Let's go before I change my mind."
So the little gingerbread man climbed onto the fox's tail and they entered the water.
Unfortunately the fox's tail began dipping into the water. "You're too heavy for my tail, he said. Climb onto my back."
The little gingerbread man did as he was asked.
But the water began creeping up the fox's back forcing the little gingerbread man to climb higher to the fox's neck. "That's not good enough, I'm afraid," said the wily fox. "Climb to my head."
Now the little gingerbread man was terrified, but what could he do? He climbed to the fox's ears.
"Oh, little gingerbread man, you have to climb onto my nose," insisted the wily fox, "otherwise I can't help you. Don't you see the water is getting even deeper?"
So the little gingerbread man reluctantly climbed onto the fox's nose. The moment he did, that wily fox tossed him into the air, opening his jaws wide with anticipation. The little gingerbread man's eyes rounded with fear because he knew he was going to be eaten. It didn't matter now how fast he could run.
But the little gingerbread man and the wily fox had forgotten about the butterfly. She swooped into that fox's jaws, grabbing her friend by one leg and rescuing him from an awful fate. She flew higher and higher until the stream and the fox were but spots on the landscape.
"You can carry me," cried the little gingerbread man.
"Yes," she answered. "I'm stronger than you could imagine. Now I'll take you somewhere safe."
She flew with him over farm fields and forests and even mountains. It felt like they had been in the sky forever when they reached a lake, its waters calm like pale glass. There was an island in the middle of the lake lined with forest trees. And among the trees was where the butterfly took the little gingerbread man. She flew down, down, and down until they came to the foot of a pine tree.
The little gingerbread man could not believe his eyes. Beneath that pine tree was the most beautiful gingerbread house.
Through the front door of the gingerbread house came a gingerbread man and a gingerbread woman. Seeing the butterfly and her companion they smiled excitedly waving their gingerbread hands.
"Oh, what have you brought us?" cried the gingerbread woman. Evidently she knew the butterfly very well.
"I think that's obvious, dear" said the gingerbread man. "She's brought us a gingerbread boy. Do you realize that now we can be the family we always wanted?"
It was true. The butterfly had intended all along to bring these three together. The little gingerbread man had not known that he was, in reality, a gingerbread boy. It was all so sudden, but wonderful. When both his gingerbread parents each gave him a loving hug he knew he was home.
The gingerbread family went inside their gingerbread house to celebrate with the butterfly remaining outside on the roof. She was content just smelling the gingerbread and sitting there quietly, whether it was day or night.	
They all lived happily ever after.

Patrick never did homework. "Too boring", he said. He played baseball and basketball and Nintendo instead. His teachers told him: "Patrick! Do your homework or you won't learn a thing." And it's true, sometimes he did feel like a ding-a-ling.
But what could he do? He hated homework.
Then on St. Patrick's Day his cat was playing with a little doll and he grabbed it away. To his surprise it wasn't a doll at all, but a man of the tiniest size. He had a little wool shirt with old fashioned britches and a high tall hat much like a witch's. He yelled: "Save me! Don't give me back to that cat. I'll grant you a wish, I promise you that."
Patrick couldn't believe how lucky he was! Here was the answer to all of his problems. So he said: "Only if you do all my homework 'til the end of the semester, that's  days. If you do a good enough job, I could even get A's."
The little man's face wrinkled like a dishcloth thrown in the hamper. He kicked his legs and doubled his fists and he grimaced and scowled and pursed his lips: "Oh, am I cursed! But I'll do it."
And true to his word, that little elf began to do Patrick's homework. Except there was one glitch. The elf didn't always know what to do and he needed help. "Help me! Help me!", he'd say. And Patrick would have to help -- in whatever way.
"I don't know this word", the elf squeeked while reading Patrick's homework. "Get me a dictionary. No, what's even better. Look up the word and sound it out by each letter."
When it came to math, Patrick was out of luck. "What are times tables?", the elf shrieked. "We elves never need that. And addition and subtraction and division and fractions? Here, sit down beside me, you simply must guide me."
Elves know nothing of human history, to them it's a mystery. So the little elf, already a shouter, just got louder "Go to the library, I need books. More and more books. And you can help me read them too."
As a matter of fact every day in every way that little elf was a nag! Patrick was working harder than ever and was it a drag! He was staying up nights, had never felt so weary, was going to school with his eyes puffed and bleary.
Finally the last day of school arrived and the elf was free to go. As for homework, there was no more, so he quietly and slyly slipped out the back door.
Patrick got his A's; his classmates were amazed; his teachers smiled and were full of praise. And his parents? They wondered what had happened to Patrick. He was now the model kid. Cleaned his room, did his chores, was cheerful, never rude, like he had developed a whole new attitude.
You see, in the end Patrick still thought he'd made that tiny man do all his homework. But I'll share a secret, just between you and me. It wasn't the elf; Patrick had done it himself!

The first element in the debate about the future of Britishness is the changing ethnic composition of the British people themselves. 
The British are not a race, but a gathering of countless different races and communities, the vast majority of which were not indigenous to these islands.
In the pre-industrial era, when transport and communications were often easier by sea than by land, Britain was unusually open to external influence; first through foreign invasion, then, after Britain achieved naval supremacy, through commerce and imperial expansion. 
It is not their purity that makes the British unique, but the sheer pluralism of their ancestry.
London was first established as the capital of a Celtic Britain by Romans from Italy. They were in turn driven out by Saxons and Angles from Germany. 
The great cathedrals of this land were built mostly by Norman Bishops, but the religion practised in them was secured by the succession of a Dutch Prince. 
Outside our Parliament, Richard the Lionheart proudly sits astride his steed. 
A symbol of British courage and defiance. 
Yet he spoke French much of his life and depended on the Jewish community of England to put up the ransom that freed him from prison.
The idea that Britain was a pure Anglo-Saxon society before the arrival of communities from the Caribbean, Asia and Africa is fantasy. 
But if this view of British identity is false to our past, it is false to our future too. 
The global era has produced population movements of a breadth and richness without parallel in history.
Today's London is a perfect hub of the globe. 
It is home to over 30 ethnic communities of at least 10,000 residents each. 
In this city tonight, over 300 languages will be spoken by families over their evening meal at home.
This pluralism is not a burden we must reluctantly accept. 
It is an immense asset that contributes to the cultural and economic vitality of our nation.
Legitimate immigration is the necessary and unavoidable result of economic success, which generates a demand for labour faster than can be met by the birth-rate of a modern developed country. 
Every country needs firm but fair immigration laws. There is no more evil business than trafficking in human beings and nothing corrodes social cohesion worse than a furtive underground of illegal migrants beyond legal protection against exploitation. 
But we must also create an open and inclusive society that welcomes incomers for their contribution to our growth and prosperity. 
Our measures to attract specialists in information technology is a good example.
Our cultural diversity is one of the reasons why Britain continues to be the preferred location for multinational companies setting up in Europe. 
The national airline of a major European country has recently relocated its booking operation to London precisely because of the linguistic variety of the staff whom it can recruit here.
And it isn`t just our economy that has been enriched by the arrival of new communities. Our lifestyles and cultural horizons have also been broadened in the process. 
This point is perhaps more readily understood by young Britons, who are more open to new influences and more likely to have been educated in a multi-ethnic environment. 
But it reaches into every aspect of our national life.
Chicken Tikka Massala is now a true British national dish, not only because it is the most popular, but because it is a perfect illustration of the way Britain absorbs and adapts external influences. 
Chicken Tikka is an Indian dish. The Massala sauce was added to satisfy the desire of British people to have their meat served in gravy.
Coming to terms with multiculturalism as a positive force for our economy and society will have significant implications for our understanding of Britishness.

SIL ruthlessly extracts financial resources from the territory where it operates.
ISIL enforcers routinely shake down civilians for cash using crude tax and protection rackets -- netting ISIL hundreds of millions of dollars. ISIL also robs banks; steals money and property; profits from oil and antiquities sales on the black market; and, most grotesquely of all, sells captured women and girls in slave auctions. ISIL not only turns a profit on its terror but uses its illicit earnings to pay its followers and fund attacks around the world.
To prevent ISIL from enriching itself, we need every country and its citizens to stop buying what ISIL is selling.
This requires unprecedented collective action that the United Nations is uniquely positioned to mobilize. Whatever its flaws, the United Nations is still the only institution that brings together all the countries of the world. And it is the best forum for the United States to spur countries to act -- and to hold them accountable when they don't.
From the launch of our counter-ISIL campaign, we have worked to get the United Nations to tackle various dimensions of the ISIL threat. In September 2014, for example, President Obama chaired a high-level Security Council meeting to address the dangerous surge in foreign terrorist fighters crossing borders to join groups such as ISIL.
Changing the DNA of a large, multilateral organization such as the United Nations to deal effectively with modern threats is not easy. Indeed, when the United Nations was created in the wake of World War II, threats came almost exclusively from one state carrying out acts of aggression against another.
As such, diplomats, foreign ministers, and ambassadors were trained to challenge these kinds of destabilizing actions in diplomatic venues such as the U.N. Security Council, the world's premier body for dealing with threats to international security. Of course, this kind of state-on-state aggression still occurs today, as we see with Russia's ongoing illegal occupation of parts of Ukraine.
But groups such as ISIL present a different kind of threat, one the drafters of the U.N. Charter could not have imagined. And to defeat these terrorist groups -- as we must and will do -- the United Nations must reach beyond the expertise of foreign ministries, and our traditional means of countering State aggression.
Instead, we must look to the policymakers who are developing innovative tactics to fight these groups, from strengthening border security and countering violent extremism in communities to choking off various sources of ISIL's financing.
One by one, the United States has been working to bring these actors into the United Nations. Last May, for example, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson joined interior ministers from around the world in an unprecedented meeting at the Security Council aimed at pressing countries to do more to counter violent extremism from within their societies and to increase cooperation to stop the flow of terrorists across borders.
Inside the $2 billion ISIS war machine
On Thursday, Secretary Lew is chairing the first-ever meeting of U.N. Security Council finance ministers to intensify international efforts on combating terrorist financing. We recognize that if we want to cut off ISIL's access to the international financial system and prevent it from raising, transferring and using funds, we need other countries on board.
The United States has already been taking clear steps to target both ISIL's ability to generate wealth and its ability to access the international financial system. To deny ISIL resources and funding streams, we have worked with our coalition partners to target ISIL's entire oil supply chain, from oil fields and refineries to tanker trucks.
In addition, to isolate ISIL from the international financial system, we've actively targeted ISIL's key financial facilitators. In fact, in the last year alone, the Treasury and State departments have sanctioned more than 30 of its senior leaders and financiers.
At today's meeting, we will ask the Security Council to adopt a major new resolution to focus its longstanding al Qaeda sanctions program on the ISIL threat. Because it started as an offshoot of al Qaeda in Iraq, ISIL has long been subject to U.N. sanctions, and all countries have a legal obligation to freeze its assets and prohibit its business dealings. But countries around the world need to do more to make these sanctions work.
The resolution we are putting forward today will help them do that, by targeting all of ISIL's funding streams: oil smuggling, extortion and taxation, robbery, kidnapping for ransom, foreign donations, trade in antiquities and the trafficking of human beings. The resolution also sets out clear guidelines and best practices for countries to identify and disrupt transactions benefiting terrorist groups.
U.N. Security Council resolutions are only as effective as their enforcement. So we will use today's meeting to put more pressure on the countries that are not acting aggressively enough -- or at all -- to cut off the funds flowing to terrorists. Such inaction puts all of our nations at risk, including the United States.
That means countries must improve their capacity to identify and block financial transactions benefiting ISIL and other terrorist groups. It means countries must do a better job identifying terrorist financiers, middlemen and other facilitators and effectively sanction and prosecute them. And it means every country must train private sector actors to identify suspicious transactions, and freeze the assets of known terrorist organizations and their supporters.
As President Obama has said, the United States will continue to lead the global coalition in our mission to destroy ISIL. We recognize that for our efforts to succeed -- and succeed they must -- we not only need to bring every component of American power to bear, but we also need other nations to do the same.
Today's U.N. meeting will bring us one step closer to doing that, as we go after the financing that fuels ISIL's terror. 

In the southern states of the USA, racial segregation was common from the late 19th century into the 1960s. Laws were passed to keep blacks from voting – for example, by imposing taxes and literacy requirements. Even violence, e.g. lynching or hangings committed by mobs, was common. Blacks and whites were separated in schools, parks, trains, hospitals and other public places. In the 1950s, the Civil Rights Movement gained strength and achieved a break-through in equal rights legislation for blacks. Lawyers for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) pressed a series of important cases before the Supreme Court which culminated in the landmark decision in Brown vs. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas (May 17,1954), in which separate educational facilities were declared unconstitutional. This decision stimulated a mass-movement to try to end the segregationist practices across the nation, particularly in the South. Martin Luther King formed a resistance movement, led by his Southern Christian Leadership Conferences (SCLC). From 1955 to 1960 some progress was made toward integrating schools and other public facilities in the upper South and the border states. One of the most famous incidents happened in 1955 in Montgomery, Alabama, when Rosa Parks refused to stand up and give her seat to a white man on the bus, which was required at that time. She was arrested and taken to jail. News of her arrest sparked a boycott of the city’s buses that lasted over a year. In 1956, the Supreme Court declared bus segregation unconstitutional, making Rosa Parks a national hero.
Following the non-violent methods of Mohandas Gandhi, the Civil Rights Movement spread across the nation, forcing the desegregation of department stores, supermarkets, libraries and cinemas. The movement reached its climax in August 1963 with a massive march on Washington, D.C. , to protest at racial discrimination and demonstrate support for major civil rights legislation that was pending in Congress. In 1964 Congress passed the civil rights act, the most far-reaching civil rights bill in the nation’s history, forbidding discrimination in public accommodations. It was followed in 1965 by the passage of the Voting Rights Act, which led to drastic increases in the numbers of registered black voters, which a resulting increase in the numbers of blacks holding elective offices.
In the years that followed, the following milestones marked the slow progress of African Americans to gain equal rights and opportunities:
In 1967 the first black mayors of major cities were elected, in 1988 Jesse Jackson was the first black with a serious chance of being chosen as a candidate for presidency, in 1989 David N. Dinkins became mayor of New York, and three years later Carol Moseley-Braun became the first black woman to be elected to the US senate. In 1933 Toni Morrison was the first African American to win the Nobel Prize for Literature and in 2000 Colin Powell, who had been the first black officer to hold the highest military post in the United States, was appointed Foreign Minister in President Bush’s Cabinet.
Today the percentage of African Americans comprises 13% of the total population. In 2000, the state with the largest percentage of African Americans in its population was Washington D.C. (61%), followed by Mississippi (37%), Louisiana (32%), South Carolina (30%) and Georgia (29%). When looking at absolute numbers, the five states with the largest African American populations were New York (3.2 million), California (2.5 million), Texas (2.5 million, Florida (2.3 million) and Georgia (2.2.million).
According to a survey carried out by the National Urban League in 2001, the most important problems that Blacks today are facing still are discrimination and racism, economic development/unemployment and education. Asked about the state of race relations in America today, 47 % said race relations were only fair, 36% saw them as poor and only 13 % considered them good. 67% don’t think that black people are accurately portrayed on TV shows and 74% considered the criminal justice system in the United States biased against blacks. On the other hand, 50% are of the opinion that black children have a good a chance as white children to get a good education.
